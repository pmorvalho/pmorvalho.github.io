Understanding the **reasoning** and **robustness** of AI systems, such as **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, is critical for ensuring their reliable use in programming tasks.  

While recent studies have assessed LLMs‚Äô ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on **accuracy**, without evaluating the **reasoning** behind those predictions. Moreover, research on the reasoning of these models has shown that LLMs can often arrive at *correct answers through flawed logic*, raising concerns about similar issues in **code understanding**.

Developing **Artificial Intelligence for Reliable Code** requires bridging the gap between *statistical learning* and *formal reasoning*. This research explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be guided and evaluated to ensure their decisions in programming contexts are **logical, interpretable, and verifiable**. Our work spans three complementary directions:  
1. analysing the **reasoning capabilities** of LLMs in understanding code,  
2. developing **formal verification frameworks** for Python using LLMs, and  
3. integrating **fault localisation and program synthesis** to enable LLM-assisted **automated program repair**.  

Together, these efforts aim to build the foundations of **trustworthy AI for software engineering**, models that not only generate correct code but can also **explain, verify, and repair** it with formal rigour.

## üîç Evaluating LLM Reasoning in Code Understanding  

In this project, we first conducted a [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443) to evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs (up to 8B parameters) can *reason* about Python programs or are merely *guessing*.  

We applied **five semantics-preserving code mutations**:
- variable renaming,  
- mirroring comparison expressions,  
- swapping if‚Äìelse branches,  
- converting `for` loops to `while`, and  
- loop unrolling.  

These transformations preserve program semantics while altering syntax.  

We evaluated **six LLMs** and performed a **human expert analysis** using *LiveCodeBench* to determine whether correct predictions stemmed from sound reasoning. Additionally, we assessed prediction **stability** under code mutations using both *LiveCodeBench* and *CruxEval*.  

[Our findings]() show that LLMs trained for code often produce *correct predictions through flawed reasoning* in **10‚Äì50% of cases**. Furthermore, many models changed their predictions across equivalent code versions, indicating a lack of **semantically grounded reasoning**.  

Based on these insights, we argue that current evaluation paradigms for LLMs in code understanding, focused primarily on accuracy, are **not fit for purpose**. Progress in this field requires shifting toward **neuro-symbolic frameworks** that prioritise **transparent reasoning** and **formal semantic guarantees**.

## üß© PyVeritas üêç: Formal Verification for Python via LLMs  

Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for **formal verification**. In contrast, languages such as **C** benefit from mature model checkers (e.g., **[CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc)**) that enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation.  

However, the **complexity of Python** and the **verbosity** of existing transpilers (e.g., *[Cython](https://cython.org)*) have historically limited the applicability of such techniques to Python programs.  

To address this gap, we developed **[PyVeritas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08171)**, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for **high-level transpilation** from Python to C, followed by **bounded model checking** and **MaxSAT-based fault localisation** in the generated C code.  

PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model-checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve **80‚Äì90% accuracy** for some models, enabling an effective development environment that supports **assertion-based verification** and **interpretable fault diagnosis** for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

## üîß Guiding LLMs for Automated Program Repair  

To further advance the reliability of AI-assisted programming, we have also explored **hybrid approaches** that combine **formal reasoning** with **LLM-based synthesis** for automated program repair.

In this direction, we integrated **[CFaults](/projects/cfaults)**, a **MaxSAT-based fault localisation tool**, with *Large Language Models (LLMs)* using a **zero-shot learning** setup to enhance automated program repair for **C programming assignments**.  

CFaults precisely pinpoints buggy statements in a C program using information from failing test cases. In our framework, the faulty statements identified by CFaults are removed, creating a **program sketch** that is then passed to the LLM.  

The LLM is asked to **synthesise replacements** for the missing code, which are validated against a test suite. If the synthesis fails, a **counterexample** from the test suite is fed back to the LLM, guiding the next iteration, following a **Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS)** loop.  

[This hybrid approach](/publications/aaai2025) enables LLMs to repair more programs and generate smaller, more precise fixes, **outperforming both purely neural and purely symbolic program repair methods**.  

By integrating formal fault localisation with adaptive synthesis, this work has demonstrated how **formal verification** and **machine learning** can complement each other to achieve **more reliable and interpretable software repair**.

Together, these efforts aim to **bridge the gap between AI-driven code generation and formal verification**, paving the way for **more transparent, reliable, and trustworthy programming AI systems**.
