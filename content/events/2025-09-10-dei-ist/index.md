summary: In this talk, I will present approaches that leverage the precision of formal logic and the adaptability of learning-based models to enable intelligent code generation, automated program analysis, and personalized, feedback-driven programming education.

abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly drives advances in how we write, understand, and teach code, the very foundations of programming are being redefined. In this talk, I will reflect on my past and current work, and outline my future research vision, at the intersection of Automated Reasoning and Machine Learning, two pillars of AI that, when combined, offer powerful frameworks for rethinking programming as both a technical and educational discipline. I will present approaches that leverage the precision of formal logic and the adaptability of learning-based models to enable intelligent code generation, automated program analysis, and personalized, feedback-driven programming education. By blending formal guarantees with data-driven methods, my goal is to advance not only the tools we use to program, but also how we learn and teach programming in an AI-driven world.
