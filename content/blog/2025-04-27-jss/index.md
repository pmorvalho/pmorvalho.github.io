Iâ€™m very happy to share that our paper *"InvAASTCluster: On Applying Invariant-Based Program Clustering to Introductory Programming Assignments"* has been accepted for publication in the *Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)*, December 2025 issue! ðŸŽ‰

In this paper, we propose InvAASTCluster, a novel approach for program clustering that uses dynamically generated program invariants to cluster semantically equivalent introductory programming assignments (IPAs).
