I’m thrilled to share that our paper, *“MENTOR: Fixing Introductory Programming Assignments with Formula-Based Fault Localization and LLM-Driven Program Repair,”* has been accepted for publication in the *Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)* (forthcoming, 2026)! 🎉

MENTOR is a semantic automated program repair (APR) framework for fixing faulty student programs. It validates candidate repairs by running the program against a test suite, then either returns the repaired program or highlights the faulty statements.

This was the main research project of my PhD. In [April 2025](/blog/2025-04-11-voa/), this work received the 3rd edition of the [Vencer o Adamastor](https://inesc.pt/en/vencer-o-adamastor-2) award, a scientific prize that recognizes innovative contributions by young scientists (under 40) in Portugal across computing, electrotechnics, and related fields.
