I am very happy to share that our paper *"Counterexample Guided Program Repair Using Zero-Shot Learning and MaxSAT-based Fault Localization"* has been accepted for publication in the 39th Annual *AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (AAAI 2025)! ðŸŽ‰


In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both FM-based fault localization and Large Language Models, via zero-shot learning, to enhance automated program repair for introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Our method uses MaxSAT-based fault localisation to identify buggy parts of a program, then presents the LLM with a program sketch devoid of these buggy statements.
