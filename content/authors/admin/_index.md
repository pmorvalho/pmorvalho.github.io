      During my MSc program, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor [Ruben Martins](https://sat-group.github.io/ruben/) on my thesis. Our primary focus was on a system called [SQUARES](http://squares-sql.github.io), which aims to generate SQL queries by utilizing input-output examples. This falls under the domain of Programming-By-Examples, a subfield of computer science. We developed [a novel encoding](https://pmorvalho.github.io/publication/cp2019/) for programs for Enumeration-based Program Synthesis.

      In the final year of my MSc, my thesis was supervised by Professor [Vasco Manquinho](http://sat.inesc-id.pt/~vmm/research/index.html). We developed a novel SQL synthesizer, [SQUARES](http://squares-sql.github.io), capable of generating SQL queries using Query Reverse Engineering (QRE), i.e., from input-output tables. QRE is a subfield of Program Synthesis whose goal is to generate programs that satisfy a given high-level specification.
